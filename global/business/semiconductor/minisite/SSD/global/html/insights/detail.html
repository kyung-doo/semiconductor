					<strong>23 April 2015</strong> - Samsung and Code Club are today opening their latest coding hub in Cardiff, following successful openings in London, Manchester and Newcastle. The launch of the Code Club at City of Cardiff Council Digital Showcase will give local school children access to the necessary facilities and resources to enjoy creative lessons in coding.<br /><br />
					Code Club is a nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged nine to eleven. Samsung has been working with Code Club since 2013, including opening five hubs across the UK, to support the aim of reaching 5,000 clubs and 70,000 children.<br /><br />
					Following the change of the national curriculum to Computing from ICT last September, which now incorporates coding into the course, the training, facilities and resources are more important than ever to help kick-start a digitally literate generation.<br /><br />
					The City of Cardiff Council Digital Showcase has been chosen to be the fourth coding hub in the UK following the first opening in London at the Dragon Hall community centre in Camden, the second in Manchester’s The Factory Youth Zone in Harpurhey and the third in Newcastle’s Blakelaw Neighbourhood Centre. The Hall will be equipped with Samsung laptops to run weekly coding sessions with young people and also host four dedicated training sessions a year to train Code Club volunteers. These volunteers will then go on to offer thousands more hours of free coding classes to children.<br /><br />
					Chief Executive of the City of Cardiff Council, Paul Orders said: "The Council is committed to supporting initiatives such as the Code Club to provide valuable opportunities for our young people. I am delighted that we can launch the Cardiff Hub today in partnership with Samsung and Code Club Wales and hopefully inspire a new generation of digital pioneers."<br /><br />
					Clare Sutcliffe, CEO of Code Club, said, “Cardiff was an obvious choice for our fourth hub with its entrepreneurial atmosphere. It’s fantastic to be holding the sessions in the City of Cardiff Council Digital Showcase, an important institution in the community, which is accessible to all schools and young people in the city and surrounding areas. In partnership with Samsung, our aim is to provide young people from all backgrounds with the opportunity to learn to code and help build the next generation of digital entrepreneurs.”<br /><br />
					Andy Griffiths, President of Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland, said: “We’re so pleased to open a new hub in Cardiff today with our partner Code Club to teach and inspire a new generation of coders across the city. At Samsung, we’re committed to giving young people access to the resources and technology they need to become digitally literate. This is more important than ever as today’s job market evolves. Future careers, either directly within the growing technology centre or outside it, increasingly require digital fluency.”
