                                        In the event SAMSUNG determines, in its sole discretion, that the Product suffers from defects in material or workmanship and does not substantially conform to the published specifications under normal use, for as long as You own the Product and during the limited warranty period, and subject to the conditions and exceptions stated in this Agreement, SAMSUNG will, at its option, either: (1) repair or replace the Product with new or refurbished Product of equal or greater capacity and functionality; or (2) refund the then current market value of the Product at the time the warranty claim is made to SAMSUNG if SAMSUNG is unable to repair or replace the Product. In the case of replacements, SAMSUNG may replace Your Product with one that was previously used, repaired and tested to meet SAMSUNG specifications. The warranty period for repaired and replaced products will be applied for the longest of the remainder of the original warranty period or ninety (90) days.
