                                        BitLocker uses software-handled encryption, but when it is linked with a storage device that supports eDrive, it can perform hardware-based encryption, thereby improving both security and performance while minimizing CPU usage.<br>
                                        After installing an operating system on a storage device that supports eDrive, run BitLocker, which will automatically link the two. Among Samsung SSD models, 840 EVO supports eDRIVE.

                                        To make calculations easier for consumers, manufactures rate drive capacity based on the assumption that 1 GB is equal to 1,000 Megabytes (MB) rather than 1,024 MB.
                                        When calculating capacity, the OS uses the more accurate 1,024MB, resulting in the discrepancy you notice when looking at the reported capacity versus the actual capacity.

                                    <p class="text">Over-provisioning comes from known free space on the drive, gaining endurance and performance at the expense of reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. <br>
                                        Some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning.<br>
                                        Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well.<br>
                                        Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.

                                    <p class="text">TRIM is a facility by which the OS can notify the SSD when data is either marked for erase or no longer valid. <br>
                                        TRIM helps to make Garbage Collection more efficient by preparing invalid data for deletion. When the OS “deletes” data, the data does not actually go anywhere.<br>
                                        The space in which it resides is simply marked as “free space” that may be used later.<br>
                                        By default, the OS doesn't let the SSD know which data is now free.<br>
                                        TRIM allows the OS to inform the SSD which data is no longer valid, allowing the SSD to skip over invalid data when performing Garbage Collection.

                                    <p class="text">840 EVO employs Turbo Write technology, which increases the write speed of low-capacity 3Bit MLC SSD by using internal SLC buffering to improve performance. <br>
                                        The technology does not write directly into 3Bit MLC. <br>
                                        instead, it writes to the SLC Buffering area. <br>
                                        Data is moved to 3Bit MLC when the SSD is not writing/reading, freeing up space in the SLC Buffering area. <br> <br>

                                        Analysis of the usage pattern of actual users revealed that about 1.17GB is written per hour on average. <br>
                                        Since most users write less than 3GB per hour, which 840 EVO is capable of, a decrease in writing performance caused by insufficient SLC Buffering area does not occur.<br>
                                        (Size of the SLC area differs for each model, but ample space is provided, ranging from 3 to 12GB.)<br><br>

                                    <p class="text">Wear leveling is a technique by which the SSD controller attempts to prolong the lifespan of the SSD by ensuring that data writes are distributed evenly among available cells. <br>
                                        Because each cell can only endure a finite number of writes/erasures, it is possible that, without wear leveling, some cells would be unevenly stressed, which would prematurely end the life of the entire SSD.

                                        In such case, the SSD must maintain consistency of the stored data.<br>

                                        The Tantalum capacitor within the SSD stores a certain amount of electricity while the power is being supplied.<br>
